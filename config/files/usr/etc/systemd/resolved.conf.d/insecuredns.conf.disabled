# INSECURE DNS CONFIGURATION
#
# This config is needed to make Captive Portals work.
# It will use the DNS Server advertized over DHCP,
# and allows exploitations like redirecting HTTP requestsy
# which are the foundation of Captive Portals.
#
# Only use this for logging in to public Networks using Captive Portals,
# and address complaints to the providers.
